# JSONPath Benchmark

[![Benchmark JSONPath](https://github.com/AsaiYusuke/jsonpath-benchmark/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AsaiYusuke/jsonpath-benchmark/actions/workflows/build.yml)

I benchmarked two JSONPaths using several libraries for the Go language.
Results can be viewed through Github actions.

The focus of the measurement is the cost per job for a task that involves a significant amount of looping after all the initial preparations are complete.

There were notable performance differences.
However, if the number of queries is limited, there will not be a significant variation between any of them.

Additionally, the results may vary depending on the input data.
Therefore, this benchmark should be considered for informational purposes only and re-evaluated at regular intervals.

## Comparing across all libraries

```
JSONPath : $.store.book[0].price
```

The following is the outcome of a JSONPath that was processed by all libraries.
The library "oliveagle/JsonPath" performed the fastest, while my own library placed second.

## Comparing with a slightly complex syntax

```
JSONPath : $..book[?(@.price > $.store.bicycle.price)]
```

Among the limited number of libraries capable of handling complex syntax, my library performed the fastest.
