# JSONPath Benchmark

[![Benchmark JSONPath](https://github.com/AsaiYusuke/jsonpath-benchmark/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AsaiYusuke/jsonpath-benchmark/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This project provides a comprehensive benchmark comparing multiple JSONPath libraries implemented in the Go programming language.
It aims to evaluate performance under specific scenarios and offer insights for developers choosing an appropriate library for their use case.

## Overview

Results are generated using GitHub Actions to ensure consistency and automation.

The focus of the benchmark is on the cost per operation after the initial setup is complete.
This means that preparatory steps, such as parsing or preloading data, are excluded from the measurements.
Instead, the benchmark emphasizes scenarios involving intensive looping or query execution within the main operation.

The results may vary depending on several factors, such as the structure of the input data, the complexity of the JSONPath queries, and the specific runtime environment.
For this reason, these benchmarks should be considered as a general reference and re-evaluated periodically.

## Libraries Benchmarked

The following libraries are included in this benchmark:

- [AsaiYusuke/JSONPath](https://github.com/AsaiYusuke/jsonpath)
- [ohler55/OjG](https://github.com/ohler55/ojg)
- [vmware-labs/YAML JSONPath](https://github.com/vmware-labs/yaml-jsonpath)
- [bhmj/JSONSlice](https://github.com/bhmj/jsonslice)
- [Spyzhov/Abstract JSON](https://github.com/spyzhov/ajson)
- [oliveagle/JsonPath](https://github.com/oliveagle/jsonpath)
- [PaesslerAG/JSONPath](https://github.com/PaesslerAG/jsonpath)

## Results: Simple Query

JSONPath:

``` text
$.store.book[0].price
```

Performance Summary:

This query was supported by all libraries included in the benchmark, enabling a direct performance comparison across all of them.
The fastest performance was achieved by `oliveagle/JsonPath`, with my library ranking second.

``` bash
{% include 'benchmark_threeLevelsWithIndex_test.result.txt' %}
```

## Results: Complex Query

JSONPath:

``` text
$..book[?(@.price > $.store.bicycle.price)]
```

Performance Summary:

This query involves more complex syntax, and only a subset of the libraries were able to process it.
Among these, my library demonstrated the best performance.

``` bash
{% include 'benchmark_recursiveDescentWithFilter_test.result.txt' %}
```

## Conclusion

This benchmark highlights significant performance differences among popular JSONPath libraries.
Developers can use these results as a reference when selecting a library, particularly when performance is critical.
For real-world use, consider running benchmarks tailored to your specific datasets and queries.
