# JSONPath Benchmark

[![Benchmark JSONPath](https://github.com/AsaiYusuke/jsonpath-benchmark/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AsaiYusuke/jsonpath-benchmark/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This project benchmarks multiple JSONPath libraries written in Go.
It evaluates performance in specific scenarios and offers guidance for selecting an appropriate library.

## Overview

Results are generated via GitHub Actions for consistency and automation.

The benchmark focuses on the per-operation cost after initial setup is complete.
Preparatory steps, such as parsing or preloading data, are excluded from the measurements.
Instead, it emphasizes scenarios with intensive looping or query execution within the main operation.

Results may vary with factors such as input structure, query complexity, and runtime environment.
Treat these benchmarks as a general reference and re-evaluate them periodically.

## Libraries Benchmarked

The following libraries are included in this benchmark:

- [AsaiYusuke/JSONPath](https://github.com/AsaiYusuke/jsonpath)
- [ohler55/OjG](https://github.com/ohler55/ojg)
- [vmware-labs/YAML JSONPath](https://github.com/vmware-labs/yaml-jsonpath)
- [bhmj/JSONSlice](https://github.com/bhmj/jsonslice)
- [Spyzhov/Abstract JSON](https://github.com/spyzhov/ajson)
- [oliveagle/JsonPath](https://github.com/oliveagle/jsonpath)
- [PaesslerAG/JSONPath](https://github.com/PaesslerAG/jsonpath)

## Results: Simple Query

JSONPath:

``` text
$.store.book[0].price
```

Performance Summary:

All libraries support this query, enabling a direct performance comparison across them.
With buffer reuse enabled, AsaiYusuke/JSONPath is the fastest; when allocating a new buffer per operation, it ranks second.

``` bash
{% include 'benchmark_threeLevelsWithIndex_test.result.txt' %}
```

## Results: Complex Query

JSONPath:

``` text
$..book[?(@.price > $.store.bicycle.price)]
```

Performance Summary:

This query uses more complex syntax, and only a subset of libraries could process it.
Among them, AsaiYusuke/JSONPath delivered the best performance.

``` bash
{% include 'benchmark_recursiveDescentWithFilter_test.result.txt' %}
```

## Conclusion

This benchmark highlights significant performance differences among popular JSONPath libraries.
Developers can use these results as a reference when selecting a library, particularly when performance is critical.
For real-world use, consider running benchmarks tailored to specific datasets and queries.
